## WALLBREAKER
# Introduction:
The Brick Breaker game is a classic arcade-style game where the player controls a paddle to
bounce a ball to break bricks. This project aims to implement a simple version of the Brick
Breaker game using C programming language on the NIOS II system.
# How to Operate:
1. Starting the Game: Compile and Launch the Game on the Quartus Monitor Program,
Press “Space” to start or “H” for the help menu.
2. Controls: Use the PS2 keyboard to control the paddle's movement. The paddle moves
horizontally at the bottom of the screen.
3. Gameplay: Hit the ball with the paddle to bounce it off and break the bricks at the top of
the screen. The ball should not fall below the paddle, or the player loses a life (displayed
on the LEDs).
4. Objective: The objective is to break all the bricks on the screen without running out of
lives. Each broken brick earns points with respect to the strength of the brick starting
from 0-6.
5. Power-Ups: Collect power-ups by hitting them with the ball. Power-ups may provide
benefits such as extra lives, faster ball speed, or an enlarged paddle.
6. Scoring: Keep track of your score on the HEX display as you break bricks and collect
power-ups. Compete with yourself or others to achieve the highest score.
7. Game Over: The game ends when the player runs out of lives. At this point, the final
score is displayed, and the player may choose to restart the game. what i currently have
